# Artificial-Neural-Networks-competition
*Artificial Neural Network and Deep Learning* is a course offered by Politecnico di Milano for the first time in the acedemic year 2019/2020 (first semester).
In this repository you can find the *Jupyter Notebooks* used by me and a colleague of mine to partecipate at the competition in that academic year (2019/2020).

The competition was divided into three challenges, each one of them cover a different topic of the course:
 - Image Classification 
 - Image Segmentation
 - Visual Question Answering
