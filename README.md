# Artificial-Neural-Networks-competition
*Artificial Neural Network and Deep Learning* is a course offered by Politecnico di Milano. In this repository you can find the *Jupyter Notebooks* used by me and a colleague of mine to partecipate at the competition in that academic year (2021/2022).

The competition was divided into Two challenges, each one of them cover a different topic of the course:
 - Image Classification




 
# Image Classification
we were required to classify images of leafs (like the ones in the example image below), which are divided into categories according to the species of the plant to which they belong. Being a classification problem, given an image, the goal is to predict the correct class label.
